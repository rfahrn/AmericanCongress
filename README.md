## Running speech complexity analysis
Download the data from [here](https://data.stanford.edu/congress_text#download-data) and unpack it into a folder called `hein-daily` in the root of this project's directory. 
Then run the `ReadRawFiles` notebook which will generate new files in the folder `preprocessed_data`. 
Consecutively, the `SpeechComplexityAnalysis` script can be run and it will save all plots in the `plots` folder.
